## About Backend

- My Backend skill is limited, so I used supabase to do the authentication and movies sharing job API.

## About unit test and integration test

- All tests located in the folder **tests** under src folder
- Run individual test by running the command
  `yarn test -- [path to the test file]`
- I don't have much experience writing tests, that's why the test files are a bit mess.
